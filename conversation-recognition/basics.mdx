### Understanding Conversation Recognition

Missio's Conversation Recognition transforms the way your team manages customer interactions. Instead of sifting through linear chat histories, this feature intelligently groups messages into conversation units based on topics, enhancing the clarity and manageability of community dialogues.

<Tip>Missio's conversation recognition instantly understands and routes customer chats to the right teams to eliminate manual triage and improve response times.</Tip>


### Key Features

- **Conversation Status**: Each Conversation is marked with a status—`Open`, `In Progress`, or `Resolved:<Resolution Reason>`—indicating the stage of resolution.
- **Auto-Labeling**: Conversations are automatically given a summary and catagory, such as `bug`, `feedback`, `question` and `feature-request`.
- **Triaging**: Manage conversations directly from Triage Command-tools in Discord or via a Missio Mission Table, with dedicated channels for Admins and Community Managers.
- **Recommended Community Manager Actions**:  Based on the identified intent behind each interaction, relevant actions are recommended to community managers such as:
  * `Respond directly to user inquiry`
  * `Query manager for more info`
  * `Request technical support input`
  * `Follow up with user`
  * `Provide troubleshooting steps`
  * `Escalate urgent issue`
  * `Send documentation`
  * `Close resolved thread`
- **Auto-Ticketing**: turn conversations into tickets in your support desk or issue tracker on `Linear`, `Asana`, `Notion`, and `Github`




### How Conversations Are Created and Catagorized

Conversations are generated from all community messages on our support platforms, including: `Discord` and `Discourse`

Each message is automatically analyzed and labeled with a category, such as `Questions`, `Bugs`, `Feature-Requests`, or `Feedback`, ensuring efficient management and response.

- **Clarity and Streamlined Management**: With each message being automatically categorized into `Questions`, `Bugs`, `Feature-Requests`, or `Feedback`, it creates a more structured and manageable environment. This makes tracking, follow-up, and addressing specific issues much simpler and more organized.
